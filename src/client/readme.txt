A note to the future maintainer.

If you want to add/change sites/schools (or any data), then just modify the /js/data/datacontext.js file.
If you want to modify the appearance of a given page, then find the *.html page in either the /js/home or /js/site folders.
If they request a new page, then hopefully you can follow the pattern established with the other pages to extend the site.
